                <h2>Dalhousie Math/Stats Graduate Seminar</h2>
                <p>In September 2023 I began organizing a seminar for graduate students in Dalhousie's Math/Stats department. The goal was to create a space where graduate students could get together, learn about each others' interests, and practice giving presentations in a chill environment. Check out the webpage we made for it hosted on google sites!</p>

                <h2>Graduate Problem Solving Seminar</h2>
                <p>Starting in January 2024 I'm co-organizing a `problem-solving' seminar for graduate students with Dr. Eswarathasan. The goal is to give graduate students opportunities to develop skills in navigating and extracting information from various research papers in a limited time-frame; in particular how to `take the next step' when inevitably getting stuck chasing rabbits.</p>
